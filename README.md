# Parse VBA macros from office documents.

This work is the golang port of https://github.com/unixfreak0037/officeparser

The goal is to be able to extract VBA macros embedded within an office document.

The code tries to stay as close as possible to the python original,
even though the original code is not idiomatic for Go.
